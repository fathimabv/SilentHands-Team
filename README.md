**SilentHands** is a team-developed, front-end web project designed to support and empower differently-abled individuals, extreme introverts, and homebound people. The platform promotes inclusivity by providing **remote work opportunities** and a space to **sell handcrafted products** online.

Built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap**, the website follows a soft, calming visual theme, prioritizing accessibility, simplicity, and user-friendly design.

- 🧵 **Handicapped or differently-abled individuals**
- 🏠 **People confined to home (elderly, home caregivers, etc.)**
- 😶‍🌫️ **Introverts seeking calm, independent work**
- 🎨 **Craftspeople selling handmade items**
The platform offers **online work-from-home jobs** and an easy-to-navigate **handcraft shop**, giving silent contributors to society a voice and a livelihood.
